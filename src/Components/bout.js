          <h1>Little Lemon</h1>
          <h3>Chicago</h3>
          <p>&nbsp; Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean
            restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern
            twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture
            and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant
            has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a
            popular place for a meal any time of the day.
            <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
            who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning
            a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and
            his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
